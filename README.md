# Arduino, Fastled & ZCPP 

This sketch is designed to handle the ZCPP Protocol for xLights and display the pixel data using a Arduino controlled device.

This is the Arduino firmware for the ESP8266/ESP32 WiFi pixel controller.  This is a small wireless ZCPP pixel controller designed to control a single strand of pixels.  Pixel limitations are mostly based upon your desired refresh rate.

## Hardware

ESP8266 or ESP32 compatible 

## Requirements

Along with the Arduino IDE, you'll need the following software to build this project:

- [Adruino for ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) - Arduino core for ESP8266
- [Arduino ESP8266 Filesystem Uploader](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin) - Arduino plugin for uploading files to SPIFFS


### Pixel Protocols

- WS2811 / WS2812 / WS2812b

### Protocols

- ZCPP
