# FastLED-ZCPP-Protocol
This sketch is designed to handle the ZCPP Protocol for xLights and display the pixel data using a Arduino controlled device.  This is the Arduino firmware for the ESP8266/ESP32 WiFi pixel controller.  This is a small wireless ZCPP pixel controller designed to control a single strand of pixels.  Pixel limitations are mostly based upon your desired refresh rate.
